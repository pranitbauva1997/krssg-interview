<h2>Hosting</h2></div>
</div>
<div class="post-content">
<p>I have to find hosting for this site. I think hosting it would add to the impression. Anywhich ways the source code is freely available on my github page. Make sure to visit it. I have written some good programs.</p>

<h2>Late Night Coding</h2></div>
</div>
<div class="post-content">
<p>As I had to make a website for KRSSG web team selections, I had to stay awake the whole night on sunday (technically monday) and code. I was familiar with HTML but did not know much about CSS. So I went to w3schools and learned it. I also learned PHP to just find out it would not be efficient for my work. So in turn I choose to work with python which I already knew. I have done a lot of backend coding before, but this was my first time doing front end web development. I just hope the selectors like it!</p>

<h2>Introduction Seminar</h2></div>
</div>
<div class="post-content">
<p>We had an introduction seminar on the KRSSG research group. It was very good. They told about the work they do. They also told that its divided between many teams like electronics, mechanical, CS, management, web, design teams. I really want to join the CS department because Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning fascinates me. Currently I think I will apply for the web team and hopefull (fingers crossed) will go to the CS team. In fact I have made this website to show it to the selectors. I hope they like it!</p>
