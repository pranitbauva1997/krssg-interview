title:Late Night Coding
content:As I had to make a website for KRSSG web team selections, I had to stay awake the whole night on sunday (technically monday) and code. I was familiar with HTML but did not know much about CSS. So I went to w3schools and learned it. I also learned PHP to just find out it would not be efficient for my work. So in turn I choose to work with python which I already knew. I have done a lot of backend coding before, but this was my first time doing front end web development. I just hope the selectors like it!
