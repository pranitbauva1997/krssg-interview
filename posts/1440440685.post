title:Introduction Seminar
content:We had an introduction seminar on the KRSSG research group. It was very good. They told about the work they do. They also told that its divided between many teams like electronics, mechanical, CS, management, web, design teams. I really want to join the CS department because Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning fascinates me. Currently I think I will apply for the web team and hopefull (fingers crossed) will go to the CS team. In fact I have made this website to show it to the selectors. I hope they like it!
