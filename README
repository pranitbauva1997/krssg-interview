I have made this website for my interview at KRSSG (IIT Kharagpur).
I have used HTML, CSS, and python.
The website is completely written in HTML and CSS with no
server side code. Initially I thought I would use PHP, but then
I realised that the server hosting the website would have to process 
a lot because whenever the page is requested it would fetch the blog posts
and then display. That would be a lot of overload. So after thinking a bit
I came up with an idea to make my own Content Management System(CMS).
Don't worry it is not a serious one. In fact a very rudimentary one just to
fill my basic needs and the best I could get with one full night of coding
as I had my physics exam after that. I made the CMS in python, and it
can be used to add posts and then update the blog after that. If I get time
I will surely try to improve it. This is my first experience writing a
web front end as I have always worked with backends before. It was an awesome
experience something different from the console (you get to use your
browser and mouse). The python code is the CMS part, not necessary to
upload on the server. Visit the website <a href="http://krssg.atwebpages.com/">
